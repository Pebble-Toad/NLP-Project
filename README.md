# Anime_Classifier
This is a respository for Group 9 where we developed an anime rating classifier based on text within the synopsis

animes_df2.csv is the dataset used

ELI5 is where we visualize the classification for logisitic regression for a document

NLPFinal_Clustering notebook covers all of our clustering experimentation. It also includes a Naive Bayes model.

animes_df2_project: 
Gensim embeddings model, logistic regression (using both features gained from CountVectorizer, TFIDF), and KNN classifications (again using both features gained from CountVectorizer, TFIDF as well as SVD)

etl_and_lr: loaded and cleaned data, created target variable, performed logistic regression with tfidf

Polarity + RF notebook covers our Vader Compound and Polarity models and also Random Forest Model with Lemmatization and TFIDF
